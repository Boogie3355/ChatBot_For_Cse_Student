Project Title: Student Chatbot with Google Authentication

This project is a responsive and interactive web-based chatbot developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with Google Firebase Authentication for secure user access. The main objective of this project is to create a smart assistant to help students with common queries, study-related questions, and basic academic support.

The chatbot interface is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It provides a conversational experience where students can interact with the bot in real-time. The design is clean and minimal, making it user-friendly and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

One of the key features of this project is the integration of Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication, which ensures that only authenticated users can access the chatbot. This adds a layer of security and personalization, allowing users to log in using their Google accounts without the need to remember additional passwords. Once signed in, the user is welcomed with their name and can begin interacting with the chatbot immediately.

The chatbotâ€™s logic is implemented using basic JavaScript conditions and keyword matching, allowing it to respond to a set of predefined questions or statements. Although it does not use AI or machine learning, it effectively demonstrates the core principles of how a chatbot interface works.

This project is ideal for beginners in web development who want to explore integrating frontend technologies with backend services like Firebase. It also introduces important concepts such as user authentication, session handling, and client-side scripting.

In the future, this chatbot can be enhanced by incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools or connecting to AI models for more advanced conversation capabilities. Additional features like chat history, feedback collection, and multilingual support can also be implemented.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of front-end web development combined with Firebase authentication to create a functional and secure student support tool.
